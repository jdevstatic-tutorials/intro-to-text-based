# Intro To Text-Based Programming
Graphical coding is the trend nowadays, particularly
for students. Even the Scratch program is graphical.

Coming exactly from the words of the developers of the
Scratch program:

1. Readability
2. Ease Of Use
3. Technical Knowledge
4. Typing

But even though graphical is the first choice,
you still need to transition to text-based
or at least have a full understanding of
text-based.

All programming languages that are being
used in the actual software development
world like in Facebook and Google companies,
they are text-based. Your graphical coding,
in structure, is very limited while
the text-based is not.

Some text-based programming languages being
used by these companies are PHP for Facebook UI,
while the core is C language. For Google, 
one is Java and the core is still C language.

Again, limitations of your graphical coding:
1. it will be very slow for a very big project
(a typical code base in the world of software
development is composed of thousands of lines,
others amounting to more than a million lines
of code)
2. the structure is limited. Programmers have
coding patterns that is really impossible to
be written using graphical coding.
