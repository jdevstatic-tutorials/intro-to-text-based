# Intro To Text-Based Programming
The very nature of the computer was text-based.
Before the advent of advanced
screens, all a computer could display
were characters and even early games just 
relied much on that.

Remember that computers will consume purely
the binary data as it is the nature of the 
computer but as for humans, it's really
tedious. So, humans and computers must meet
halfway: text that humans can easily recognize.

But text will still return to binary data
through character encoding: the specific
pattern for each character expressed as bits.

Graphical coding is just for beginners and 
this was just lately developed. Beginners
back then had the option to start with the 
original BASIC language
but still it was originally text-based.

## Objectives
1. display knowledge of the text-based
programming
2. compare text-based and graphical coding
3. utilize the text-based using the VEX VR
4. utilize their existing programming knowledge
and skills for the text-based programming
5. utilize the Coral Reef Cleanup Map with
the aim of finishing the mission using 
text-based programming

## Intro
Graphical coding is the trend nowadays, particularly
for students. Even the Scratch program is graphical.

From Coding Kids site, reasons why beginners use
graphical coding:

1. Readability
2. Ease Of Use
3. Technical Knowledge
4. Typing

But even though graphical is the first choice,
you still need to transition to text-based
or at least have a full understanding of
text-based.

All programming languages that are being
used in the actual software development
world like in Facebook and Google companies,
they are text-based. Your graphical coding,
in structure, is very limited while
the text-based is not.

Some text-based programming languages being
used by these companies, such as PHP for
Facebook scripting
while the core is C language. 
For Google, they heavily use 
Java and the core is still C language.

Limitations of graphical coding:
1. It will be very slow for a very big project
(a typical codebase in the world of software
development is composed of thousands of lines,
others amounting to more than a million lines
of code).
2. The structure is limited. Programmers have
coding patterns that are really impossible to
be written using graphical coding.

## VEX VR Text-Based Programming
VEX VR Code is based on Python while
RobotC is based on C.

From w3schools site:

What can Python do?
> > Python can be used on a server to create 
web applications.
>
> > Python can be used alongside software 
to create workflows.
>
> > Python can connect to database systems.
It can also read and modify files.
>
> > Python can be used to handle big data
and perform complex mathematics.
>
> > Python can be used for rapid 
prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python?
> > Python works on different platforms 
(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
>
> > Python has a simple syntax similar 
to the English language.
>
> > Python has syntax that allows developers 
to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
>
> > Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning 
that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
>
> > Python can be treated in a 
procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

### Thread And Main Thread
A `thread` in a programming language is a 
separate program execution. The `main` thread
in VEX VR (the `when started` block) is 
the main thread. Without the main thread
all commands are just declarations.
### Common Keywords & Symbols
`import` - import commands from an existing
library. All commands that you are dragging
from the left pane are predefined coming
from the internal library of VEX. Without
this, you will manually do that.

`def` - define commands, declarations, etc.,
they are just declarations

`vr_thread` - the thread that usually contains
the main thread, without this, your program
will not run

`#` - for Python, this is the symbol to start
commenting

`.` - the dot, a separator to separate the
object and its attribute For example, `dog` is an 
object, it has the
attribute `smell`, you will be writing that as
`dog.smell`

### To Camel Case Or To Not Camel Case
What if I tell you it's just a convention?

Yes, the most important one is that you stick
to one agreement. But other parts of the
Python code must be written in a specific way.
And any naming convention must be succinct.
