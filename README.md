# Intro To Text-Based Programming
## Objectives
1. display knowledge of the text-based
programming
2. compare text-based and graphical coding
3. utilize the text-based using the VEX VR
4. utilize their existing programming knowledge
and skills for the text-based programming
5. utilize the Coral Reef Cleanup Map together
with the text-based programming

## Intro
Graphical coding is the trend nowadays, particularly
for students. Even the Scratch program is graphical.

Coming exactly from the words of the developers of the
Scratch program:

1. Readability
2. Ease Of Use
3. Technical Knowledge
4. Typing

But even though graphical is the first choice,
you still need to transition to text-based
or at least have a full understanding of
text-based.

All programming languages that are being
used in the actual software development
world like in Facebook and Google companies,
they are text-based. Your graphical coding,
in structure, is very limited while
the text-based is not.

Some text-based programming languages being
used by these companies are PHP for Facebook UI,
while the core is C language. For Google, 
one is Java and the core is still C language.

Again, limitations of your graphical coding:
1. it will be very slow for a very big project
(a typical code base in the world of software
development is composed of thousands of lines,
others amounting to more than a million lines
of code)
2. the structure is limited. Programmers have
coding patterns that is really impossible to
be written using graphical coding.

## VEX VR Text-Based Programming
VEX VR Code is based on Python while
the RobotC is based on C.

### Thread And Main Thread
A `thread` in a programming language is a 
separate program execution. The `main` thread
in VEX VR (the `when started` block) is 
the main thread. Without the main thread
all commands are just declarations.
### Common Keywords & Symbols
`import`    
`def`   
`vr_thread`   
`#`   
`.`   

### To Camel Case Or To Not Camel Case
What if I tell you it's just a convention?

Yes, the most important one is that you stick
to one agreement.
